            <!--<p> review below here-->
            <p><em>V for Vendetta</em> is a thrilling movie filled with great action sequences along with an in-depth storyline that will make you question the world around you. In this movie, the main charater, V, is a human with exceptional physical and mental gifts that he unleashes to take down a corrupt authoritarian government. As his plan unfolds, he encounters Evey and with her help realizes that even though he is driven by vengence, his overall goal is noble. I really enjoy this movie because it has its violent action but also has a great script wih quotes from past great writers. The movie also pulls at your heart strings in multiple ways to get you more invested in it.</p>

                <h3><em>V for Vendetta</em> Trivia</h3>

                <!--unordered list of movie trivia - 3 minimum-->

                <ul>

                    <li>Trivia #1:The domino scene, where V tips over black and red dominoes to form a giant letter V, involved 22,000 dominoes. It took four professional domino assemblers 200 hours to set it up.</li>
                  
                    
               
                    <li>Trivia #2: Evey mentions to Gordon Dietrich that "eggie in the basket" is the same breakfast V made for her the first morning she spent at his place. She fails to mention (or doesn't notice) that Dietrich and V also greeted her in exactly the same way, not with "good morning", but with "bonjour mademoiselle". Also, Stan Getz is playing in the background in both instances.</li>
                 
                                      
            
                    <li>Trivia #3:  The cast and crew were only allowed to shoot near the British Parliament and Big Ben (the clock tower) from midnight to 4:30 a.m., and they could only stop traffic for four minutes at a time.</li>
